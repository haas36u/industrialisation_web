## How can I contribute ?

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on Github.

Just be careful about : 

- **Add tests!** - Your patch probably won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests. Any new tests must be placed in the tests/OpenCFP directory and properly namespaced at OpenCFP\Test. There will be an ongoing effort to move remaining tests from tests/unit into that namespace.

- **Tests must be clear in meaning** - We value clarity in meaning / purposes behind tests. If there is excessive setup required for a test, it should be hidden behind an intention-revealing (and possibly re-usable) method.

- **Create feature branches** - Feature branches are critically important if you're going to be sending us more than one contribution. Don't send a PR from master!

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests. Large pull requests are difficult to review and manage.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. Appropriate formatting of commit messages is also appreciated!

- **Don't close issues via commit message** - We would rather handle these actions ourselves, especially for longer-running issues that may have many PRs submitting against them.
